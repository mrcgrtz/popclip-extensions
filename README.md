# My Popclip extensions

These are some personal Popclip extensions I use on a regular basis.

## List of extensions

 * **Jira ID**<br>
   ![Jira ID Sample](https://cdn.rawgit.com/Dreamseer/popclip-extensions/master/jira-id-sample.png)<br>
   You all know this: The Project Manager Guy comes along asking “Hey,
   what about LOLPROJECT-1337? Will it be in the release next week?”, or
   the Controlling Guy asks “Can you put some estimates on AWESOME-42?”
   And you need to fire up your browser, type in the URL of your Jira
   installation, append the ticket ID… ugh! Struggle no more, here comes
   the Popclip Jira ID extension: Just select the ticket ID, click the
   fancy Jira icon in Popclip and… abracadabra, there you go!
