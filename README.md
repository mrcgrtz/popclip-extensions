# My PopClip extensions

These are some personal [PopClip](https://pilotmoon.com/popclip)
extensions I use on a regular basis.

## List of extensions

* **Jira ID**  
  ![Jira ID Sample](https://cdn.rawgit.com/Dreamseer/popclip-extensions/main/jira-id-sample.png)  
  You all know this: The Stake Holder Guy comes along asking “Hey, what about LOLPROJECT-1337? Will it be released next week?”, or the Product Owner Guy asks “Can you put some estimates on AWESOME-42?” And you need to fire up your browser, type in the URL of your Jira installation, append the ticket ID … ugh! Struggle no more, here comes the PopClip Jira ID extension: Just select the ticket ID, click the fancy Jira icon in PopClip and abracadabra, there you go! Additionally the URL is put into your clipboard.
* **Redact**  
  Replaces selected text with a pre-defined symbol. Useful if the Slack Admin Guy disables deletion of messages while still allowing editing.
* **Open in Chrome Canary**  
  This is almost the same extension as [Open in Chrome](https://pilotmoon.com/popclip/extensions//page/OpenInChrome), but it opens the current URL in Chrome Canary. (You could also use [Choosy](https://www.choosyosx.com/) and the [Choosy PopClip Extension](https://github.com/georgebrock/choosy-popclip).)
